# Predicting the Fuel consumption of cars
## Problem Description

The basic idea of analysing the Auto mpg dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the aggregate fuel consumption of each car.  

Cars of different variants of different models of various Car manufacturing companies from origin countries such as USA, Japan and Europe.

Fuel consumption of car is affected by various factors such as Model year, Horsepower, Number of Cylinders present, displacement, Weight and Acceleration of the car.

We need to find which factors mostly affect the Fuel consumption of a car in order to improve the mpg value.

Hence build a model to predict the mpg value of each car.


## Features on data set

**cylinders:** contains the number of cylinders present in the car

**displacement:** contains the Displacement of the car

**horsepower:** contains the Horsepower of the car

**weight:** contains the weight of the car

**acceleration:** contains the Acceleration of the car

**model_year:** contains the model year of the car

**origin:** contains the origin country which car belong to

**car_name:** contains the name of the car(Brand-Model-Variant)

## Target Variable 

**mpg:** contains the fuel consumption value(in Miles per Gallon) for car
 
 ## Model description

• Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn libraries have been used for Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization.

• Categorical Features are encoded using OneHotEncoder and LabelEncoder.

• Feature Scaling, and Feature Selection Techniques have been performed.

• Linear Regression, Support Vector Regressor, Random forest Regressor, Gradient boosting Regressor model have been used to predict the mpg values.

**• Accuracy score:** ***91%*** using ***Random Forest Regressor.***

## Inference 
Car's Fuel consumption(in mpg) is mostly affected by ***weight*** and ***Displacement*** of the car.
